===================================================================================================================================

Full Stack Developer
--------------------

I'm a full-stack developer (and Global Top 20 Female Xbox Gamer 🎮) with 5 years of experience specializing in Python, Django, React, PostgreSQL, AWS, and Docker. I’m passionate about crafting gamified digital experiences that drive engagement, boost retention, and inspire positive change. Currently, I’m focused on building features for a menopause health app—transforming the way individuals navigate hormonal shifts by delivering supportive, empowering experiences. My recent interests include Next.js and Celery as I deepen my work in asynchronous backend development and modern frontend architecture.

By combining technical expertise with user-centered design, I’ve developed interactive solutions that not only engage users, but also foster a sense of community and achievement. Whether it’s through personalized challenges, progress tracking, or thoughtful rewards, my work is all about creating meaningful digital experiences that resonate deeply with users.

What I bring to the table:

✔ Expertise in gamification strategies that turn everyday activities into exciting, rewarding experiences.

✔ A passion for developing impactful health tech solutions that make lives better.

✔ Collaborative teamwork with cross-functional teams to deliver features that exceed user expectations.

I thrive in environments where creativity meets purpose and where technology can make a lasting difference in people’s lives. Let’s connect to talk about health tech, gamification, or how we can build engaging solutions together! 🌟
